usage:
- enable "plain text replies" somewhere in the outlook365 settings
- hit "reply" / "reply all" over an email
- expand the [...] button with history
- copy the screen text into a file "email.txt" next to this .pl script
- call "perl <script-name.pl>"
- copy the contents of "email.txt" back to the screen
